## Hello

Well, I thought it was past time to start a website. I have been doing things.
Mostly, I've been applying for jobs, working on my house, and writing. For example:

- I have a [substack](https://heatherzoppetti.substack.com/).

- I have [some short stories](https://blog.reedsy.com/creative-writing-prompts/author/heather-zoppetti/).

- I have a [mini project on GitHub](https://github.com/hzoppetti/meow).

- I wrote a novel I'm trying to get people to read.

In general, I'm trying not to go nuts or drive my pets and husband nuts.

I had some excitement with a kidney stone which sent me to the hospital. It was not fun.
I'm okay.

## What's next

To be honest, interviewing has been both exhausting and disheartening. Every application has had a technical assignment. Finding the motivation to sit down and work on my own site has been difficult. Every time I sit down to work on this site I wonder why bother.

However, I've been meaning to set up a simple static site for some time and I found this basic template to play with Next.js. It was quite old and only supported outdated versions of React, etc. I've updated it intending to build some sample projects and making a portfolio of both coding and technical writing. We will see.

I'm also hoping to add sections such as creative writing. I'm spending most of my non-interview time writing fiction because I find joy in it. Something about writing characters and exploring different aspects of human nature is interesting. Humans are interesting.

I chose not to include commenting functionality. I went this direction because, well; I have anxiety. I could have included some plugin or coded a solution, however, yeah... It would have gone one of two ways:

1. No comments - I would stress over lack of engagement.
2. Comments - I would analyze every word and stress over each one. Further, for every ten positive comments, one negative comment makes me feel bad about myself. I don't need that.

Are these things realistic? Probably not. What do they say about me? I'm insecure and not fit for today's social media world. This is my personal space, not a company page. Okay. Moving on.
